# Random-Forest
Random forest and Boosting are the techniques used to improve the efficieny of ID3 Machine Learning Decision Tree Algorithm.Random Forest and Boosting codes implement these techniques.
In Both techniques trees are constructed using adult.txt dataset and tested using testing data set.
randomforest.cpp file implement randomforest techniques.
boosting.cpp implement boosting technique.
